Year 2027:
  Jan 5: Renew (new year) → Expires Dec 31, 2027 ✅

## 🔍 Database Verification Queries

### Check card_valid_until Updates

```sql
-- View all members with expiry dates
SELECT 
    id,
    memberName,
    email,
    DATE(card_issued_at) as joined_date,
    DATE(card_valid_until) as expiry_date,
    renewal_status,
    renewal_count,
    DATE(last_renewed_at) as last_renewal
FROM registrations 
WHERE login_status = 'approved' OR renewal_status = 'approved'
ORDER BY card_valid_until DESC;
```

### Verify All Expire on Dec 31

```sql
-- Check all members expire Dec 31
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_members,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN MONTH(card_valid_until) = 12 AND DAY(card_valid_until) = 31 THEN 1 END) as expiring_dec_31,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN MONTH(card_valid_until) != 12 OR DAY(card_valid_until) != 31 THEN 1 END) as not_dec_31
FROM registrations 
WHERE (login_status = 'approved' OR renewal_status = 'approved')
AND card_valid_until IS NOT NULL;
```

**Expected:** `not_dec_31` = 0 (all should be Dec 31)

### Check Renewal History

```sql
-- Member renewal history
SELECT 
    memberName,
    renewal_count,
    DATE(card_issued_at) as first_joined,
    DATE(last_renewed_at) as last_renewed,
    DATE(card_valid_until) as current_expiry,
    DATEDIFF(card_valid_until, NOW()) as days_remaining
FROM registrations 
WHERE id = [member_id];
```
