## 🎯 Test Summary

**Overall Status:** 🟢 **ALL FUNCTIONALITY WORKING**

---

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Incorrect Filament Namespaces
**Problem:** Gallery form was using incorrect `Filament\Schemas\Components\*` namespace  
**Error:** `Class "Filament\Schemas\Components\TextInput" not found`

**Solution:**
- Changed imports from `Filament\Schemas\Components\*` to `Filament\Forms\Components\*`
- Changed method from `->schema()` to `->components()`
- Kept the return type as `Schema` (matches project structure)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Filament/Resources/Gallery/Schemas/GalleryForm.php`

### Issue 2: Missing Section Component
**Problem:** `Section` component not available in Filament Forms  
**Error:** `Class "Filament\Forms\Components\Section" not found`

**Solution:**
- Removed Section wrapper
- Simplified form to use direct components with `->columnSpanFull()`
- Maintained all form functionality

### Issue 3: Wrong Actions Namespace
**Problem:** Actions imported from `Filament\Tables\Actions\*` instead of `Filament\Actions\*`  
**Error:** `Class "Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction" not found`

**Solution:**
- Changed imports from `Filament\Tables\Actions\*` to `Filament\Actions\*`
- Verified against other working resources (Renewals, Registrations, Offers)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Filament/Resources/Gallery/GalleryResource.php`
