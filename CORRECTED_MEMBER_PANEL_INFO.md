# ✅ CORRECTED: Member Panel URL Information

## 🎯 Correct Member Panel URL

**Your site uses a Filament Member Panel, not custom routes!**

### ✅ Correct URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/member/panel
```

### ❌ What I Mistakenly Did:
I accidentally created custom routes at `/member/panel/login` which conflicted with your Filament panel.

### ✅ What I Fixed:
- Removed the conflicting custom routes from `routes/web.php`
- Updated all test scripts to use the correct Filament panel URL
- Your Filament member panel is now fully functional
