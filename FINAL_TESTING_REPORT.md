## 🐛 Bugs Found & Fixed

### Bug #1: Database Query Error
**Error:** `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'is_active' in 'where clause'`

**Location:** 
- `app/Filament/Member/Widgets/MemberStatsWidget.php` (line 24)
- `resources/views/filament/member/widgets/member-offers-list.blade.php` (line 36)

**Root Cause:** The offers table uses `active` column, not `is_active`

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// Before
$offersCount = $member->offers()->where('is_active', true)->count();
@if($offer->is_active)

// After
$offersCount = $member->offers()->where('active', true)->count();
@if($offer->active)
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and verified

---

### Bug #2: Unsupported Filament Banner Component
**Error:** Component rendering issues with `x-filament::banner`

**Location:**
- `resources/views/filament/member/widgets/member-card.blade.php`
- `resources/views/filament/member/widgets/member-offers-list.blade.php`

**Root Cause:** `x-filament::banner` is not available in current Filament version

**Fix Applied:**
Replaced with native HTML/Tailwind CSS:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<x-filament::banner color="warning" icon="heroicon-o-clock">
    Your membership card will expire soon
</x-filament::banner>

<!-- After -->
<div class="p-3 rounded-md border border-yellow-200 text-yellow-800 bg-yellow-50 dark:border-yellow-800 dark:text-yellow-200 dark:bg-yellow-900/20">
