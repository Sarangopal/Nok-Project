---

## ⚠️ **6. EVENTS MANAGEMENT** - **MISSING**

### Status: **NOT IMPLEMENTED** ❌

#### Current State:
- ❌ No Event model
- ❌ No database migration for events table
- ❌ No Filament resource for admin management
- ❌ Static `/events` route (returns hardcoded Blade view)
- ❌ No WYSIWYG editor integration
- ❌ No single event page with full details

#### **ACTION REQUIRED**: Create complete Events Management system
- [ ] Create `Event` model and migration
- [ ] Create Filament `EventResource` with WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE/CKEditor)
- [ ] Update `/events` route to pull from database
- [ ] Create single event page (`/events/{slug}`)
- [ ] Add image upload for event banner
- [ ] Add event categories/tags
- [ ] Add publish/draft status

---

## ✅ **7. SECURITY & VALIDATION** - STRONG

### Status: **WELL IMPLEMENTED** ✅

#### A. CSRF Protection
- ✅ `@csrf` tokens in all forms
- ✅ `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware active
- ✅ Session-based token validation

#### B. Input Validation
- ✅ **Registration**: 25+ validated fields, unique email, required civil_id
- ✅ **Contact Form**: Required fields, max lengths, email format
- ✅ **Member Login**: Email, civil_id, password validation
- ✅ **Verification**: String validation, max 50 chars

#### C. SQL Injection Prevention
- ✅ **Eloquent ORM**: All queries use parameter binding
- ✅ **Query Builder**: Proper where clauses, no raw SQL
- ✅ **Validation**: Input sanitization before database queries

#### D. Password Security
- ✅ **Auto-hashing**: `setPasswordAttribute` mutators in User & Member models
- ✅ **bcrypt**: Industry-standard hashing algorithm
- ✅ **Hidden attributes**: Passwords never serialized in JSON
- ✅ **Session regeneration**: On login to prevent fixation attacks

#### E. File Upload Safety
- ✅ **QR Codes**: Generated server-side, stored in `storage/app/public/qr_codes/`
- ✅ **Photos**: Stored with unique names, proper disk configuration
- ✅ **PDF Generation**: Server-side via DomPDF (no user uploads)

#### F. Authentication Guards
- ✅ **Separate guards**: `web` (admin), `members` (members)
- ✅ **Middleware protection**: All protected routes use proper guards
- ✅ **Guest middleware**: Login pages inaccessible when authenticated

#### G. Rate Limiting
- ✅ **Verification endpoint**: `throttle:10,1` (10 per minute)
- ✅ **Prevents brute force**: On public endpoints
