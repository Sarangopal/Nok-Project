## 🤖 Automatic Testing (CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Automation

Tests run automatically on:
- ✅ Every push to `main`, `develop`, or `staging`
- ✅ Every pull request
- ✅ Daily at 2 AM UTC
- ✅ Manual trigger via GitHub UI

### What Happens Automatically:
1. Code is checked out
2. PHP 8.2 environment is set up
3. Dependencies are installed
4. Database is created and migrated
5. Unit tests run in parallel
6. Feature tests run in parallel
7. Browser tests run
8. Code style is checked (Laravel Pint)
9. Security vulnerabilities are scanned
10. Coverage reports are generated
11. Results are uploaded as artifacts

### Viewing CI/CD Results:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. See test results for each commit/PR
4. Download artifacts (coverage, screenshots)

---

## 📊 Test Reports

### Generated Reports

#### 1. Test Results (`test-results/`)
- `unit-tests-[timestamp].txt` - Unit test results
- `feature-tests-[timestamp].txt` - Feature test results
- `database-tests-[timestamp].txt` - Database test results
- `auth-tests-[timestamp].txt` - Authentication test results
- `renewal-tests-[timestamp].txt` - Renewal system tests
- `registration-tests-[timestamp].txt` - Registration tests
- `verification-tests-[timestamp].txt` - Verification tests

#### 2. Coverage Reports (`coverage/`)
Generate with:
```bash
vendor\bin\phpunit --coverage-html coverage
```
Open `coverage/index.html` in browser to see:
- Line coverage percentage
- Branch coverage
- Uncovered lines highlighted
- File-by-file breakdown

#### 3. Health Check Report
Run `php health-check.php` for instant system status
