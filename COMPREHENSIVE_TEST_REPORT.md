### 5. ✅ Renewal Request System

**System Architecture:**

**Two Separate Sections:**

2. **Renewal Requests** (`/admin/renewal-requests`) - Member-initiated requests

**Member Workflow:**
1. Member logs in and sees expired/expiring card warning
2. Clicks "Request Renewal" button
3. Request sent to admin with `renewal_requested_at` timestamp
4. Admin reviews request in "Renewal Requests" section
5. Admin approves → card renewed with new expiry date (end of year)
6. Email sent to member with renewed card and credentials

**Admin Actions Available:**
- Approve renewal (extends card to end of current year)
- Reject renewal (with optional reason)
- Reset password
- Resend credentials email

---

### 6. ✅ Email Notification System

**Email Types Configured:**

1. **Membership Card Email** (`MembershipCardMail`)
   - Sent when: Admin approves new registration or renewal
   - Contains: Member details, login credentials, membership card PDF attachment
   - Template: `resources/views/emails/membership/card.blade.php`

2. **Renewal Reminder Emails**
   - Scheduled at: 30 days, 15 days, 7 days, 1 day before expiry
   - Template: `resources/views/emails/membership/renewal_reminder.blade.php`
   - Command: `php artisan schedule:work` (runs reminders)

3. **Registration Confirmation Email**
   - Sent when: Member submits new registration
   - Template: `resources/views/emails/membership/registration_confirmation.blade.php`

**Email Configuration Required:**
Update `.env` file with SMTP details:
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Nightingales of Kuwait"
