## ✅ All Tasks Completed Successfully

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Failure** ✅
**Issue:** Automated testing failing due to deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`  
**Solution:** Updated to `@v4` in 3 locations  
**File:** `.github/workflows/automated-tests.yml`  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

### 2. **Member Card Download Button Missing** ✅
**Issue:** Approved members couldn't see download button  
**Root Cause:** Widgets checked only `renewal_status`, not `login_status`  
**Solution:** Updated all member widgets to check BOTH statuses (OR logic)  
**Files Modified:** 7 widget files  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

### 3. **Renewal Date Not Extending** ✅
**Issue:** When admin approved renewal, date stayed at 2025 instead of extending to 2026  
**Root Cause:** `computeCalendarYearValidity()` always returned current year end  
**Solution:** Added `$isRenewal` parameter to extend by +1 year  
**Files Modified:** 
- `app/Models/Registration.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/RenewalRequests/Tables/RenewalRequestsTable.php`  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

### 4. **Status Inconsistency** ✅
**Issue:** Member status showed "Pending" even though they could login  
**Solution:** Updated stats widget to check both `login_status` and `renewal_status`  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

### 5. **Renewal Widget Visibility** ✅
**Issue:** User wanted to hide renewal and offers widgets  
**Solution:** Commented out widgets in `MemberDashboard.php`  
**Later:** Re-enabled renewal widget to demonstrate functionality  
**Status:** Configurable per user preference ✅

## 📊 Key Understanding Established

### "Total Renewals: 6" vs Empty "Renewals" Page

**NOT A BUG** - These are different things:

```
Dashboard "Total Renewals" = 6
↓
Counts: Total renewal REQUESTS submitted
Location: Found in "Renewal Requests" page
URL: /admin/renewal-requests

"Renewals" Page = Empty  
↓
Shows: Members who NEED to renew NOW
Filter: card_valid_until <= now() + 30 days
Status: Empty (all cards expire in 63 days)
```

## 🎓 What We Learned

### 1. **Dual Status System:**
Members have TWO approval statuses:
- `login_status` (for new registrations)
- `renewal_status` (for renewals)

**Best Practice:** Always check BOTH with OR logic:
```php
if ($member->login_status === 'approved' || $member->renewal_status === 'approved')
```

### 2. **Three Types of Renewal Pages:**
Each serves a different purpose:
- **Renewals:** Who NEEDS to renew (proactive)
- **Renewal Requests:** What's been SUBMITTED (reactive)
- **Approved Renewals:** What's been APPROVED (historical)

### 3. **Time-Based Functionality:**
Features activate based on expiry dates:
- Renewal button: <30 days
- Color warnings: <30 days = yellow, expired = red
- Admin filters: Same logic
