# ✅ Expiry Dates & Renewal Reminders - Complete Verification

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL WORKING CORRECTLY (After Fix)

---

## 🔧 **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**

### **🔴 ISSUE FOUND:**

**Renewal Expiry Date was WRONG!**

**Before Fix:**
```php
// app/Filament/Resources/RenewalRequests/Tables/RenewalRequestsTable.php (Line 95)
$record->card_valid_until = now()->endOfYear();  // ❌ WRONG!
```

**Problem:** When approving renewal, it set expiry to December 31 of **CURRENT year**, not NEXT year!

**Example:**
- Renewed on 2025-10-27
- ❌ Before: Expiry set to 2025-12-31 (only 2 months!)
- ✅ After: Expiry set to 2026-12-31 (14 months!)

### **✅ FIX APPLIED:**

```php
// app/Filament/Resources/RenewalRequests/Tables/RenewalRequestsTable.php (Line 97)
$record->card_valid_until = now()->addYear()->endOfYear();  // ✅ CORRECT!
```

**Now works as expected:**
- Renewed on 2025-10-27 → Expiry: 2026-12-31 ✅

---

## 📋 **REQUIREMENT VERIFICATION**

### **✅ Requirement 1: New Member Registration**

**Rule:** Expiry date should always be **December 31 of the same year**

**Example:**
- Registered on 2025-11-15 → Expiry: 2025-12-31 ✅

**Implementation:**

**File:** `app/Models/Registration.php` (Lines 41-54)

```php
protected static function booted(): void
{
    static::saving(function (Registration $registration) {
        $isLoginApproved = $registration->login_status === 'approved';
        $isRenewalApproved = $registration->renewal_status === 'approved';
        
        if (($isLoginApproved || $isRenewalApproved) && !$registration->card_valid_until) {
            $baseDate = $registration->last_renewed_at ?: $registration->card_issued_at ?: now();
            $registration->card_valid_until = Carbon::parse($baseDate)->endOfYear();
        }
    });
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. Member registers → Admin approves
2. `login_status` changes to 'approved'
3. Model's `booted()` method automatically sets `card_valid_until` to **end of current year**
4. Email sent with membership card

**Status:** ✅ **WORKING CORRECTLY**

---

### **✅ Requirement 2: Membership Renewal**

**Rule:** Expiry should move to **December 31 of the next year**

**Example:**
- Current expiry: 2025-12-31
- Renewed on 2025-10-27 → New expiry: 2026-12-31 ✅

**Implementation:**

**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/RenewalRequests/Tables/RenewalRequestsTable.php` (Lines 82-116)

```php
Action::make('approve')
    ->label('Approve Renewal')
    ->modalDescription('This will extend the membership card validity to December 31 of next year.')
    ->action(function ($record) {
        $record->renewal_status = 'approved';
        $record->last_renewed_at = now();
        $record->renewal_count = ($record->renewal_count ?? 0) + 1;
        
        // ✅ FIXED: Set expiry to December 31 of NEXT year
        $record->card_valid_until = now()->addYear()->endOfYear();
        $record->save();
        
        // Send membership card email
        Mail::to($record->email)->send(new MembershipCardMail(['record' => $record]));
    });
```

**How It Works:**
1. Member submits renewal request
2. Admin approves renewal
3. System updates:
   - `renewal_status` → 'approved'
   - `last_renewed_at` → current date/time
   - `renewal_count` → increments by 1
   - `card_valid_until` → **December 31 of NEXT year** ✅
4. New membership card email sent

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED & WORKING CORRECTLY**

$record->card_valid_until = now()->endOfYear();  // Set by model's booted() method
$record->save();

Mail::to($record->email)->send(new MembershipCardMail(['record' => $record, 'password' => $generatedPassword]));

### **✅ Email After Renewal Approval**

**Trigger:** Admin approves renewal request

**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/RenewalRequests/Tables/RenewalRequestsTable.php`

**Command:** `app/Console/Commands/SendRenewalReminders.php`

```php
public function handle(): int
{
    $daysList = [30, 15, 7, 1, 0];  // Days before expiry
    
    foreach ($daysList as $days) {
        // Find members expiring in exactly $days
        $targetDate = $days === 0 ? now() : now()->addDays($days);
        
        $members = Registration::query()
            ->where('renewal_status', 'approved')
            ->whereDate('card_valid_until', '=', $targetDate)
            ->get();
        
        foreach ($members as $member) {
            // Send reminder email
            Mail::to($member->email)->send(new RenewalReminderMail($member, $days));
            
            // Log to database for tracking
            RenewalReminder::create([
                'registration_id' => $member->id,
                'member_name' => $member->memberName,

                'days_before_expiry' => $days,
                'status' => 'sent',
