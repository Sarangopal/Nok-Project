### Setup Renewal Reminders (Cron Job)

The system sends automatic renewal reminder emails at:
- **30 days** before expiry
- **15 days** before expiry
- **7 days** before expiry
- **1 day** before expiry

#### Manual Test:
```powershell
php artisan members:send-renewal-reminders --days=30,15,7,1
```

#### Schedule (runs daily at 8 AM):
```powershell
# In production, add to Windows Task Scheduler:
# Program: C:\laragon\bin\php\php-8.2.x\php.exe
# Arguments: artisan schedule:run
# Start in: F:\laragon\www\nok-kuwait
# Trigger: Daily at 8:00 AM
```

Or use Laravel's built-in scheduler:
```powershell
php artisan schedule:work
```
