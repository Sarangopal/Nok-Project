## 📅 Card Validity Rules

### For New Registrations
```
Registration Date: Any date in 2025
Card Valid Until: 2025-12-31
```
**Example:**
- Member joins on March 15, 2025
- Card valid until December 31, 2025
- Duration: ~9 months

### For Renewals
```
Renewal Approved: Any date in 2025
Card Valid Until: 2026-12-31
```
**Example:**
- Member renewed on November 1, 2025
- Old expiry: December 31, 2025
- New expiry: December 31, 2026
- Duration: ~13-14 months

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Member Can't Login
1. Check Civil ID is correct (case-sensitive)
2. Verify password is correct
3. Check member status:
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker --execute="App\Models\Registration::where('civil_id', 'TEST814485')->first(['login_status', 'renewal_status'])"
   ```
4. Member must have `login_status = 'approved'` OR `renewal_status = 'approved'`

### Renewal Button Not Showing
1. Check card expiry date:
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker --execute="App\Models\Registration::where('civil_id', 'TEST814485')->value('card_valid_until')"
   ```
2. Button only shows when card expires in ≤30 days
3. Button hidden if renewal already requested (status = 'pending')

### Reminder Emails Not Sending
1. Check email configuration in `.env`
2. Verify cron job is running:
   ```bash
   php artisan schedule:work
   ```
3. Manually trigger:
   ```bash
   php artisan members:send-renewal-reminders
   ```
4. Check logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

### Card PDF Not Generating
1. Verify route exists:
   ```bash
   php artisan route:list | grep membership-card
   ```
2. Check member ID is correct
3. Verify PDF library installed:
   ```bash
   composer show | grep pdf
   ```
