|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 30 days | 🟢 GREEN | ✅ Yes (30-day reminder) |
| 15 days | 🟠 YELLOW | ✅ Yes (15-day reminder) |
| 7 days | 🔴 RED | ✅ Yes (7-day reminder) |
| 1 day | 🔴 RED | ✅ Yes (1-day reminder) |
| 0 days (expired) | 🔴 RED | ✅ Yes (expired notice) |

So members in:
- 🟢 GREEN zone: Already received 30-day reminder
- 🟠 YELLOW zone: Already received 30 & 15-day reminders

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Days Are Calculated:
```php
// Integer only (no decimals)
$days = (int) now()->diffInDays($card_valid_until, false);

// Examples:
19.9 days → Shows as "19 days"
19.1 days → Shows as "19 days"
0.5 days → Shows as "0 days" (Expires Today)
-1.8 days → Shows as "Expired 1 days ago"
```

### Why Integer?
- ✅ Cleaner display
- ✅ Easier to understand
- ✅ No confusing decimals
- ✅ Matches user expectations
