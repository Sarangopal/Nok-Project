## 📧 Membership Card Email Class

**File:** `app/Mail/MembershipCardMail.php`

### Smart Email Detection

The email template automatically detects the scenario:

```php
// Line 2-8: NEW REGISTRATION
@if($record->login_status === 'approved' && !$record->last_renewed_at)
    # 🎉 Congratulations, {{ $record->memberName }}!
    Your membership registration has been successfully approved.
    Welcome aboard to the Nightingales of Kuwait family!

// Line 9-14: RENEWAL
@elseif($record->renewal_status === 'approved' && $record->last_renewed_at)
    # 🎉 Congratulations, {{ $record->memberName }}!
    Your membership renewal has been successfully approved.
    Thank you for continuing your journey with us!
```

**Detection Logic:**
- ✅ New Member: `login_status = 'approved'` AND `last_renewed_at = null`
- ✅ Renewal: `renewal_status = 'approved'` AND `last_renewed_at` exists

### Email Constructor

Supports both scenarios:
```php
public function __construct($data)
{
    if (is_array($data)) {
        $this->record = $data['record'] ?? $data;
        $this->password = $data['password'] ?? null;  // Only for new members
    } else {
        $this->record = $data;
        $this->password = null;
    }
}
```

**Flexible Input:**
- New member: `['record' => $member, 'password' => $generatedPassword]`
- Renewal: `['record' => $member]` (no password needed)
