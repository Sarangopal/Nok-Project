## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: Status Inconsistency
**Problem:** Members could login but couldn't download card
**Root Cause:** Widgets checked only `renewal_status`, but login checked `login_status OR renewal_status`
**Solution:** Updated all member widgets to check BOTH statuses

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `resources/views/filament/member/widgets/member-card.blade.php`
- ✅ `resources/views/filament/member/widgets/member-offers-list.blade.php`
- ✅ `app/Filament/Member/Widgets/MembershipCard.php`
- ✅ `app/Filament/Member/Widgets/MemberStatsWidget.php`
- ✅ `app/Filament/Member/Widgets/MemberProfileTableWidget.php`

### Fix #2: Renewal Date Not Extending
**Problem:** When admin approved renewal, card expiry stayed at Dec 31, 2025 instead of extending to Dec 31, 2026
**Root Cause:** `computeCalendarYearValidity()` always returned current year end
**Solution:** Added `$isRenewal` parameter to extend by 1 year

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `app/Models/Registration.php` - Added year extension logic
- ✅ `app/Filament/Resources/RenewalRequests/Tables/RenewalRequestsTable.php` - Pass `isRenewal=true`

**Example:**
| Before Renewal | After Approval |
|---------------|----------------|
| Dec 31, 2025 | Dec 31, 2026 ✅ |

### Fix #3: GitHub Actions Deprecated
**Problem:** Automated tests failing due to `actions/upload-artifact@v3` deprecation
**Solution:** Updated to `@v4`

**File Updated:**
- ✅ `.github/workflows/automated-tests.yml` - 3 instances updated

## 📊 Understanding the Page Structure

### Admin Panel Pages:

1. **New Registrations** (`/admin/registrations`)
   - Shows all registrations (approved, pending, rejected)
   - Can approve/reject new members
   - Generates password and NOK ID on approval

2. **Renewals** (`/admin/renewals`)
   - Shows approved members who NEED to renew
   - Filter: `card_valid_until <= now() + 30 days`
   - Currently empty: All cards expire Dec 31, 2025 (60+ days)

3. **Renewal Requests** (`/admin/renewal-requests`)
   - Shows submitted renewal requests
   - Can approve/reject with payment proof review
   - Approving extends card by 1 year

4. **Approved Renewals** (`/admin/approved-renewals`)
   - View-only list of approved renewals
   - Historical record

## 🎯 Current System Behavior

### New Member Flow:
1. Member registers → `login_status = 'pending'`
2. Admin approves → `login_status = 'approved'`, `card_valid_until = Dec 31, 2025`
3. Member can login and download card

### Renewal Flow:
1. When card < 30 days to expiry → Renewal button appears in member panel
2. Member submits renewal request with payment proof → `renewal_status = 'pending'`
3. Admin approves → `renewal_status = 'approved'`, `card_valid_until` extends by 1 year
4. Example: Dec 31, 2025 → Dec 31, 2026 ✅

### Why "Renewals" Page is Empty:
- Page shows members whose cards expire within 30 days or already expired
- All current members expire Dec 31, 2025 (63+ days away)
- **This is correct behavior!**
- Page will populate in early December when members reach <30 days
