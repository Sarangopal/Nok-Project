## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Wrong: Using Example Username
```bash
* * * * * cd /home/u123456789/domains/nok-kuwait.com/public_html && ...
```
(This is just an example - won't work!)

### ✅ Correct: Using YOUR Username
```bash
* * * * * cd /home/u987654321/domains/nok-kuwait.com/public_html && ...
```
(Replace with your actual username from File Manager)

---

### ❌ Wrong: Guessing the Path
```bash
* * * * * cd /var/www/html && ...
```
(This is not how Hostinger structures directories)

### ✅ Correct: Copy from File Manager
```bash
* * * * * cd /home/u987654321/domains/nok-kuwait.com/public_html && ...
```
(Exact path from Hostinger File Manager)

---

### ❌ Wrong: Missing public_html
```bash
* * * * * cd /home/u987654321/domains/nok-kuwait.com && ...
```
(Missing the public_html folder!)

### ✅ Correct: Include public_html
```bash
* * * * * cd /home/u987654321/domains/nok-kuwait.com/public_html && ...
```
(Include the full path to where Laravel is installed)

---

## 🎯 Quick Verification Test

Once you think you have the right path, test it via SSH:

```bash
# Connect to SSH, then:
cd /home/YOUR_USERNAME/domains/YOUR_DOMAIN/public_html

# Check if Laravel is there:
ls -la

# You should see:
# - artisan
# - app/
# - public/
# - vendor/
# etc.

# Test the command:
php artisan --version
```

**If you see Laravel version output, you're in the right place!** ✅

## 💡 Pro Tips
