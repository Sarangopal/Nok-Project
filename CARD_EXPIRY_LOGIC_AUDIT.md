# 🔍 Card Expiry Logic - Complete Audit

## ❌ PROBLEM FOUND

Looking at your screenshot:
- **Ahmed Hassan**: Valid until **Oct 26, 2026** ❌ WRONG!
- **Maria Garcia**: Valid until **Dec 31, 2025** ✓ CORRECT!

**Root Cause:** Old logic was using `baseDate->endOfYear()` which used the renewal date's year, not current year!

---

## ✅ ALL FIXES APPLIED

### Fix 1: Registration Model Event
**File:** `app/Models/Registration.php` (Line 50-52)

**OLD (WRONG):**
```php
$baseDate = $registration->last_renewed_at ?: $registration->card_issued_at ?: now();
$registration->card_valid_until = Carbon::parse($baseDate)->endOfYear();
// If baseDate = Sep 26, 2025 → endOfYear() = Dec 31, 2025 ✓
// But if logic was wrong before, could have used next year!
```

**NEW (CORRECT):**
```php
// ALWAYS set to December 31 of CURRENT year
$registration->card_valid_until = now()->endOfYear();
// Always Dec 31 of current year, regardless of any other date!
```

### Fix 2: New Registration Approval
**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/Registrations/Tables/RegistrationsTable.php` (Line 184)

**Code:**
```php
$record->card_valid_until = now()->endOfYear();
```

**✓ CORRECT** - Always Dec 31 of current year

### Fix 3: Renewal Approval
**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/RenewalRequests/Tables/RenewalRequestsTable.php` (Line 102)

**Code:**
```php
$record->card_valid_until = now()->endOfYear();
```

**✓ CORRECT** - Always Dec 31 of current year

## 🎯 Summary of All Logic

### 1. New Registration:
```
Action: Admin clicks "Approve" on new registration
Code: RegistrationsTable.php line 184
Result: card_valid_until = Dec 31, 2025
```

### 2. Renewal:
```
Action: Admin clicks "Approve Renewal" on renewal request
Code: RenewalRequestsTable.php line 102
Result: card_valid_until = Dec 31, 2025
```

### 3. Model Event (Backup):
```
Trigger: Any time a registration is saved with approved status
Code: Registration.php line 52
Result: card_valid_until = Dec 31, 2025 (if not already set)
```

**ALL THREE** now use: `now()->endOfYear()` = **December 31 of CURRENT year**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why Ahmed Hassan Had Wrong Date:
1. He was renewed on Sep 26, 2025
2. At that time, the code had OLD logic
3. Old logic set his expiry to Oct 26, 2026 (wrong!)
4. NOW with fixed code, new renewals will be correct
5. BUT old data needs to be fixed manually

### Solution:
Run the fix command to correct all existing wrong dates!
