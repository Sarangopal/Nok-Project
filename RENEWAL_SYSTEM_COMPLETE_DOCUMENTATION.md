## 🔧 Renewal Logic

### **Card Validity Rules:**

1. **New Registration:**
   - Card valid until **December 31 of the current year**
   - Example: Registered in March 2025 → Valid until Dec 31, 2025

2. **Renewal:**
   - Card extended to **December 31 of the year AFTER current expiry**
   - Formula: `Current Expiry + 1 Year → End of Year`

### **Renewal Examples:**

| Current Expiry | Renewal Year | New Expiry | Explanation |
|----------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Dec 31, 2024 | 2024 | **Dec 31, 2025** | Regular renewal before expiry |
| Dec 31, 2025 | 2025 | **Dec 31, 2026** | Regular renewal before expiry |
| Dec 31, 2026 | 2026 | **Dec 31, 2027** | Regular renewal before expiry |
| Dec 31, 2026 | 2025 | **Dec 31, 2027** | Early renewal (still extends by 1 year) |

### **Implementation:**

```php
public function computeCalendarYearValidity(?Carbon $baseDate = null, bool $isRenewal = false): Carbon
{
    if ($isRenewal && $this->card_valid_until) {
        // For renewals, extend to December 31 of the NEXT year
        $currentExpiry = Carbon::parse($this->card_valid_until);
        return $currentExpiry->addYear()->endOfYear();
    }
    
    // For new registrations, set to December 31 of the current calendar year
    return now()->endOfYear();
}
```

## 📧 Automatic Reminder Emails

### **Scheduler Configuration:**

**File:** `routes/console.php`

```php
Schedule::command('members:send-renewal-reminders')
    ->dailyAt('08:00')
    ->timezone('Asia/Kuwait')
    ->name('Send Renewal Reminder Emails')
    ->description('Automatically sends renewal reminder emails to members');
```

**Settings:**
- **Frequency:** Daily at 08:00 AM
- **Timezone:** Asia/Kuwait (GMT+3)
- **Command:** `php artisan members:send-renewal-reminders`

### **How It Works:**

1. **Daily Execution:** Runs every day at 8 AM Kuwait time
2. **Finds Eligible Members:** Checks all members with cards expiring in 30, 15, 7, 1 day(s)
3. **Duplicate Prevention:** Skips if reminder already sent for that interval
4. **Sends Email:** Sends reminder email via configured mail driver
5. **Logs Record:** Saves reminder record in `renewal_reminders` table
6. **Admin Visibility:** Appears immediately in Admin Dashboard

## 🖥️ Hostinger Cron Setup

### **Quick Setup Instructions:**

1. **Login to Hostinger hPanel:**
   - Go to: https://www.hostinger.com/
   - Login → Select your hosting plan

2. **Access Cron Jobs:**
   - Find "Advanced" section
   - Click "Cron Jobs"

3. **Create New Cron Job:**
   - **Common Settings:** Custom
   - **Execute:** Daily
   - **Hour:** 08:00 (or your preferred time)
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     cd /home/your-username/public_html/nok-kuwait && php artisan members:send-renewal-reminders
     ```

4. **Save and Activate**

### **Alternative: Manual Cron Syntax**

```bash
0 8 * * * cd /home/your-username/public_html/nok-kuwait && php artisan members:send-renewal-reminders >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

**Explanation:**
- `0 8 * * *` = Every day at 08:00 AM
- `cd /home/your-username/...` = Navigate to project directory
- `php artisan members:send-renewal-reminders` = Run command
- `>> /dev/null 2>&1` = Suppress output (optional)

### **Verify Cron is Working:**

1. Wait 24 hours after setup
2. Login to Admin Dashboard → Reminder Emails
3. Check if new reminders were sent
4. Verify `created_at` timestamps are from the cron run time

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Reminder emails not being sent**

**Solution:**
1. Check cron job is set up correctly in Hostinger
2. Verify mail configuration in `.env`:
   ```env
   MAIL_MAILER=smtp
   MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-server
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
   MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@nokkw.org
   MAIL_FROM_NAME="NOK Kuwait"
   ```
3. Test manually: `php artisan members:send-renewal-reminders`
4. Check logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### **Issue: Reminders not showing in Admin Dashboard**

**Solution:**
1. Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
2. Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM renewal_reminders ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10`

### **Issue: Renewal not extending to correct date**

**Solution:**
- Verify `computeCalendarYearValidity()` method in `app/Models/Registration.php`
- Run test: `php verify_renewal_examples.php`
- All tests should PASS

### **Issue: Members not receiving emails**

**Solution:**
1. Check member's email is valid in database
2. Check spam folder
3. Verify SMTP credentials are correct
4. Test mail sending: `php artisan tinker` → `Mail::raw('Test', function($m) { $m->to('test@example.com')->subject('Test'); });`
