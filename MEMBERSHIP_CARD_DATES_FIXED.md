# ✅ Membership Card Dates - VERIFIED & FIXED

## 🔍 What I Checked

### When Renewal Request is Approved:

**Fields Updated:**
```php
renewal_status = 'approved' ✓
last_renewed_at = today (e.g., Sep 26, 2025) ✓
renewal_count = increases by 1 ✓
card_valid_until = Dec 31, 2025 ✓
```

**Field NOT Updated:**
```php
card_issued_at = stays original registration date ✓
(This is intentional - preserves join date)
```

## 📧 What's on the Membership Card

### BEFORE Fix (Confusing):
```
Date of Membership: 15-03-2024
Date of Expiry: 31-12-2025
```
❌ Not clear if this is renewed or not

### AFTER Fix (Clear):

**New Member Card:**
```
Member Since: 15-03-2024
Valid Until: 31-12-2025
Contact No: +965XXXXXXXX
```

**Renewed Member Card:**
```
Member Since: 15-03-2024  ← Original join date
Renewed: 26-09-2025 (2x)  ← NEW! Shows renewal date + count
Valid Until: 31-12-2025   ← Expiry date
Contact No: +965XXXXXXXX
```

✅ Much clearer!
