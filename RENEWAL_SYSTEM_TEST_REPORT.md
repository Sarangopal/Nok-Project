## 6️⃣ Card Validity Logic

### ✅ **PASSED**

**Business Rules Verified:**
1. ✅ **New registrations:** Card valid until **Dec 31 of current year**
2. ✅ **Renewals:** Card extended to **Dec 31 of NEXT year**
3. ✅ **Always Dec 31:** All cards expire on December 31, regardless of renewal date

**Example:**
- Member renews on **Nov 1, 2025**
- Old expiry: Nov 16, 2025
- New expiry: **Dec 31, 2026** ✅ (not Nov 16, 2026)

**Code Implementation:**
```php
public function computeCalendarYearValidity(?Carbon $baseDate = null, bool $isRenewal = false): Carbon
{
    if ($isRenewal && $this->card_valid_until) {
        // For renewals, extend to December 31 of the NEXT year
        $currentExpiry = Carbon::parse($this->card_valid_until);
        $nextYear = $currentExpiry->year + 1;
        return Carbon::create($nextYear, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59);
    }
    
    // For new registrations, ALWAYS set to end of CURRENT year
    return now()->endOfYear();
}
```
