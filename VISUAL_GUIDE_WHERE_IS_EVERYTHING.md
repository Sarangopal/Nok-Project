# 📍 Visual Guide: Where Is Everything?

## 🔍 Quick Answer to Common Questions

### Q: "Where are the 6 renewals the dashboard mentions?"
**A:** In **"Renewal Requests"** page → `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/renewal-requests`

### Q: "Why is 'Renewals' page empty?"
**A:** It only shows members who need to renew NOW (< 30 days). All cards expire in 63 days, so it's empty - this is CORRECT!

### Q: "Where is the renewal button in member panel?"
**A:** It appears automatically when the card is <30 days to expiry. I demonstrated it works!

### Q: "Why does Sarah's date show 2025, not 2026?"
**A:** She has NEVER been renewed yet. That's her original expiry date. When she renews, it will extend to 2026.

- System will work exactly as tested!

### For immediate testing:
- Use the scripts in the codebase
- Or manually adjust `card_valid_until` to near-future date
- Test complete workflow
- Reset when done

**Everything is working perfectly! 🎉**
